# Exploring Twitter Reactions to the CNN Town Hall on Gun Violence
## Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization: STAT 5702 Spring 2018

On February 14, 2018, a student walked into Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL and shot 34 people with an AR-15 weapon, killing 17 of them. While tragic, mass shootings are not exactly uncommon in the United States, and are often rarely mentioned after the news cycle moves on. This Parkland shooting, however, has remained under the spotlight. Since the shooting, several student leaders from SDHS have emerged as prominent activists for gun control. They have impressively managed to sublimate their experiences into momentum for a movement that has founded the organization Never Again MSD, that has in turn organized multiple nationwide marches and voter registration events. All of this has already resulted in [meaningful policy changes](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-policy-is-already-changing-in-the-wake-of-parkland/). 

In this project, we return to the genesis of this movement for some insights about its staying power. Eight days after the shooting at SDHS, CNN hosted a live, televised Town Hall on gun control where all three groups of stakeholders — the policy makers, the student survivors, and the public — participated, both at Parkland, FL and online. We see this town hall as a microcosm of this shooting’s impact on the zeitgeist. We have centered our project’s investigation into this topic around the content of the debate and the public’s tweets about it in real time.
