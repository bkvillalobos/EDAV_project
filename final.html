        Exploring Twitter Reactions to the CNN Town Hall on Gun Violence

        Introduction

    </h2>
    <p>
        In late February, following a shooting at a High School in Parkland, Florida, some of the survivors, their parents, and teachers were invited to a televised town hall to ask uncensored questions about and discuss gun violence and related topic with Senators Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson, House of Rep. Member Ted Deutch, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel and National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch, among others. The event was moderated by Jake Tapper of CNN.
    </p>
    <p>
        The CNN town hall garnered significant public attention not only for the tragic nature of the shooting at the Stoneman Douglas High School, which took the lives of 17 students and teachers, but also because of the political, legislative, and law-enforcement issues that are inextricably tied with gun violence in the US. In a series of appearances unprecedented in a disturbingly long history of frequent shooting incidents, some among the students have spoken extensively and eloquently on the need for greater gun-control, which spurred further attention and interest in the already prominent and highly polarized debate regarding gun violence in the US. In the weeks after the shooting and preceding the CNN town hall, this has been one of the most discussed political topics in the public sphere as reflected on social and traditional media.
    </p>
    <p>
        The event and was the first opportunity for some the loudest and most authentic critics of [what are perceived by many as] lax gun laws to discuss the issue with policymakers, law-enforcement, as well as a representative of the National Rifle Association. As such, the CNN town hall has itself been the subject of great public attention; an obvious source to look to for the public’s authentic, uncensored reactions was Twitter.

    <h2>
        Background & Project Motivation
    </h2>
    On February 14, 2018, a student walked into Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL and shot 34 people with an AR-15 weapon, killing 17 of them. While tragic, mass shootings are not exactly uncommon in the United States, and are often rarely mentioned soon after the incidents as the news cycle moves on. This Parkland shooting, however, has resiliently  remained at the center of public political attention much longer. Since the shooting, several student leaders from SDHS have emerged as prominent activists for gun control. They have impressively managed to sublimate their emotions and opinions following this shooting into momentum for a movement that has founded the organization Never Again MSD, that has in turn organized multiple nationwide marches and voter registration events.  All of this has already resulted in <a target="_blank" href=”https:///www.fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-policy-is-already-changing-in-the-wake-of-parkland”> meaningful policy changes </a>. 

    In this project, we return to the genesis of this movement for some insights about its power to remain in the spotlight. Eight days after the shooting at SDHS, CNN hosted a live, televised Town Hall on gun control where all three groups of stakeholders &mdash; the policy makers, the student survivors, and the public &mdash; participated, both at Parkland, FL and online. We see this town hall as a microcosm of this shooting’s impact on the zeitgeist. We have centered our project’s investigation into this topic around the content of the debate and the public’s tweets about it in real time.
    <h2>
        About the Town Hall 
    </h2>

    <br>
    Some of the survivors, their parents, and teachers were invited to a televised town hall to ask uncensored questions about and discuss gun violence and related topic with Senators Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson, House of Rep. Member Ted Deutch, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel and National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch, among others. Significant time was allocated to students Emma Gonzalez and Cameron Kansky to ask questions of Loesch and Rubio respectively. The event was moderated by Jake Tapper of CNN.
    The town hall lasted from 9pm on to 11pm Eastern time (2-4 GMT). Throughout, people were actively live-tweeting their thoughts about the debate. We decided to use a random sampling of these tweets as representative of public opinion - which of course has its limitations: twitter users skew younger, are generally more politically engaged, and the most prolific tweeters are the ones who have the most partisan things to say. However, since we have no reason to believe that twitter users are more likely to lean partisan in one direction over another, we think that tweet data is the most effective way to capture the gist of the public reaction to the town hall.

    <h2>
        Our Questions 
    </h2>
    <p>
            In our effort to understand how the three stakeholder groups &mdash; especially the public &mdash; metabolized the Parkland shooting, we  focused our inquiry on three EDA questions:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    How did tweeters feel about the participants in the debate, especially the policy makers?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Can we get a snapshot of how tweeters reacted to the debate in different parts of the country?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What were the most important topics discussed? What direction is the gun violence and control narrative going?
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    <h2>
        Our Methods
    </h2>
    Before we get into what we found, let’s talk about how we found it.
    <h4>Requested API access from Twitter</h4>
    The publicly-available Twitter API only allows you to query the last 7 days of data, and with very limited search operators. Clearly, this is not sufficient for our use case. We submitted an application to request sandbox enterprise access to Twitter’s API in order to access tweets from the debate back in February with a more granular search. The approval process took about two weeks.
    <h4>Sample Tweet Data w/ API queries</h4>
    Under our sandbox account, we only had an allowance of 100 queries, each returning at most 500 tweets. We used ~15 queries on prototyping (i.e. malformed queries, figuring out which hashtag returned the most tweets, etc.). Ultimately, the hashtag #CNNTownHall (hashtags are not case sensitive) yielded the most results per-query. 
    We started by sampling the the data at one-minute intervals. We did this for the first 22 minutes of the debate, before switching to two-minute intervals for the last ~100 minutes of the debate, so that we wouldn’t run out of queries before capturing the whole time series between 2am and 4am GMT. This means there is some discontinuity in our data (i.e. ~2-minute jumps in the time over the course of the debate), but since we have no reason to think that there should be any systematic bias in data sampled at two-minute intervals, we are comfortable considering our data to be a random sample of any given time period. It is especially comforting to know that tweet tweets do not map one-to-one to real-time events (i.e. someone can tweet about something that happens 5 seconds or five minutes after).
    A subtle note about this sampling method: each twitter query starts from the ending timestamp and works backwards. Therefore, each of these discontinuous jumps in time is anchored to the ends of these two-minute time intervals, and we find that our 500-tweet queries tend to capture about 30 seconds of data in real time at the back-ends of these two-minute intervals.
    As these tweets were iteratively sampled, they were persisted to disk as JSONs on-line (in case something happened in the middle of data collection, we didn’t want to waste any queries). You can find the full dataset (compressed) here <LINK>, with the query parameters as the name of the JSON.
    <h4>Object-Oriented ETL</h4>
    Once we had all the tweets in JSON format on disk, we wrote some object-oriented code <LINK> for iterating through the JSONs and extracting useful tweet properties as object properties. This greatly increased our rapid prototyping time in creating datasets for visualizations.
    <h4>Individual Data Set Prep</h4>
    Once we had our data on disk and our ETL pipeline, we parallelized the work for individual visualizations. Each of us processed the object-oriented data into more workable dataframe-style datasets, that were then persisted and used for our visualizations.
    <h4>Visualizations in R and D3</h4>
    The visualizations here were designed to be interactive, informative, and adhere to the best practices of data presentation we’ve learned in this course. They were implemented using D3 and Shiny.


    <h2>
        About the Data Set
    </h2>
    In the end, we ultimately had 33,480 tweets to work with, of which about a third (13,231) were unique. This means that around two-thirds of our dataset are retweets. 
    <img src="images/eda_num_tweets.png " alt="Marco Rubio in CNN Townhall" align="middle" width = "600">
    <br>
    We agonized over whether or not to include retweets in our queries (and, ultimately, our analysis). On the one hand, it is redundant data - on the other hand, retweets reflect which tweets and sentiments the most traction and were the most publicized. We decided to include the retweets, but the reader should note the "bias" this introduces into our sample.
    We also noticed that there are some data quality issues.  Twitter has recuently switched to a 240 character limit, but their enterprise API endpoint currently only gives us the first 140 characters of the tweet text (the old limit). This means that tweets longer than 140 characters are cut off, as shown below:
    <img src="images/eda_sample_tweet_texts.png" alt="Marco Rubio in CNN Townhall" align="middle" width = "900">
    <br>
    For our geographic analysis, we had access to the longitude and latitude coordinates for 19,892 of these tweets.
    <img src="images/eda_has_location_data.png" alt="Marco Rubio in CNN Townhall" align="middle" width = "600">
    <br>
    Of course, it was important for us to establish whether or not these data were missing at random. We performed a chi-squared test and found that there was no significant differences between the population densities of these cities and whether or not their coordinates were included in our dataset. Here are the top 20 cities in our dataset:
    <img src="images/eda_top_20_locations.png" alt="Marco Rubio in CNN Townhall" align="middle" width = "600">
    <br>
    There were 183 unique cities in our dataset overall.
    <h2>
        Analysis Overview
    </h2>
        <p>
            With the aim of enabling a visual exploration of three aspects of the public reaction to the TV event as well as the content of the event itself, we developed three corresponding interactive visualization tools. These three aspects of the public reaction to the event as reflected on Twitter and the town hall itself are:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The volume of reactions to the various personalities involved in or conspicuously absent from the CNN town hall, and its evolution through the duration of the event.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The geographical distribution of the tweets about the town hall, and its evolution through the duration of the event, tied to the most frequently tweeted words in each state [which may be a function of political attitudes in the area, among other variables].
                </li>
                <li>
                    The major topics of discussion extracted from the transcript of the CNN town hall event, their relative distance (between their estimated distributions), and the most (uniquely) prominent two-word phrases within each topic.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Reactions to Participants
        </h3>
            <p>
                The first interactive tool shows the volume of reactions to the various personalities involved in or conspicuously absent from the CNN town over time. It renders a plot with the number of tweets about a person selected from the drop-down menu indicated on the left y axis. Time is on the x axis, to show how the volume of tweets about the person evolved during the town hall event. Since the left y axis, indicating the number of tweets, dynamically adjusts its scale to the range of the number of tweets about a particular person, there is an additional static, colored right y axis to allow intuitive cross-person number-of-tweets comparisons via a sequential palette matching the color of the observations: thus even the highest data points for a less-mentioned among the people will have the brighter color. An additional feature is a sentiment analysis indicator: upon hovering over any dot, i.e. observation, the plot shows the text of the most negative and positive tweet (as well as the number of tweets) about that person during that minute of the debate.
            </p>

            <hr>
            <p>
                It’s not surprising to see that for most participants, the mentions in tweets are correlated with the time they appear in the debate. That’s particularly noticeable for Cameron Kasky, Emma Rodriguez and Rep. Ted Deutch, where the distribution of tweets seems to resemble a shifted exponential distribution: people reacted a lot to the remarks when those have been made and then less and less with the debate moving on. This reveals how people use twitter to instantaneously react about some remarks and events.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, some other personalities caught our attention in the sense that at the very beginning of the debate, people where tweeting about them, despite their absence from the stage or even taking part in the debate at all. President Trump, for example, did not take part in the debate but was still mentioned more often than other participants. This is paradoxically due to him not taking part in the debate: people would express their discontent about him turning down the CNN invitation to confront the students. Trump’s counterprogramming his own reception with some of the students and parents at the same time must have contributed to his prominence in the tweets.
            </p>
            <p>
                People were also tweeting about Dana Loesch, the NRA spokeswoman, prior to her being on stage, and by analyzing the tweets we can see that she was not unknown to the public: particularly, a lot of anti-NRA tweets mentioned her at the beginning of the debate.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s worth lingering over Marco Rubio’s tweets mentions overtime. As one can see on the corresponding graph, Senator Rubio was featured the most during the debate, with about 230 tweets per minute during the first two-thirds of the debate. By analyzing the tweets over time, one can notice two key moments of the debate when people were tweeting about Sen. Rubio. The first one corresponds to the moment when Rubio was heckled by the father of a girl who died in the shooting, qualifying the statements he made prior to the debate as “pathetically weak,” followed by a standing ovation and a huge applause from the crowd. The sentiment analysis clearly shows us that the content of the tweets were mostly against Rubio and supportive of the father who asked for a total ban of guns. Some of the tweets about Sen. Rubio are very fervently negative or even vulgar, showing the discontent of the tweeters and the tweeters’ desire to see things changing. However, one may wonder what fraction of the population those tweets are representative of, and what range of the different political views it reflects. Indeed it seems that people mainly tweet only to express their dissatisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second important moment is when Sen. Rubio faced Cameron Kasky, a bold student who asked him whether he would continue accepting money for his campaign from the NRA (c.f. picture at the beginning of the blog post). This very question provoked a lot of reactions online. The majority of the tweets praised the student, often stressing how he “destroyed” or “crushed” the senator.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, the graph shows us that after 10:20pm, the tempest of tweets against Rubio slowed down as he left the stage and gave the floor to Dana Loesch, who seemed to gather the majority of the mentions (and the scorn) for her confrontation with Emma Rodriguez.
            </p>


        <h3>
            Geographic Insights
        </h3>
            <p>
                The below interactive tool renders dots on a map of the US to represent all the tweets posted from a specific geographic location (latitude-longitude) and minute since the start of the event. The desired minute since the beginning of the event can be selected by the slider -  ranging from 0 (9 pm local time)  to  120 (11 pm). Finally, upon clicking on an area within any of the US states, the application will display below a collection of words most frequently mentioned in tweets by users from the selected state up to the specified minute during the town hall.
            </p>
            <iframe src="https://edavproject.shinyapps.io/geoloc_app/" width="1100" height="800"></iframe>
            <p>
                It is advisable to be wary of inferring specific propositions about the geographical character of a phenomenon based on observations plotted on a map, which may reflect differences in population density rather than an underlying pattern of interest.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, because the tool allows for comparisons over time via the interactive slider, we can obtain certain findings or tentative hypotheses about the relative volume of tweets within specific areas/states over time, as the town hall progressed, as well as across areas/states, if one keeps in mind the quite-well-known general facts about population density.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, for instance, one can most easily notice that the volume of tweets increases with time within almost all non-coastal areas; more specifically, for large areas in the Southwest and the (western parts of the) Midwest, the relative within-area volume of the tweets increases markedly as the town hall event evolves. One can explore the within-trend with more granularity by focusing on a specific state over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, comparing the volume of tweets across areas or states in a responsible and informative manner is possible when one keeps in mind the population density of various states and urban areas [should we attach a map?]: people in certain parts of New Mexico, Arizona, Montana, and on the border between North Dakota and Montana appear to be posting on Twitter about the town hall more than many in similarly sparsely populated areas. This sort of finding may lead to further geographic hypotheses about gun ownership rates or political leanings and inclinations to tweet about the event: within Texas, Austin, a more Democrat-leaning city, seems to be less active than Dallas, though they are of similar sizes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, by utilizing the feature that yields the most frequently tweeted words in a state up to a point during the town hall event, one can explore peculiarities of commentators in a state. An interesting example is the prominent appearance of (Jake) Tapper in North Dakota, which gives another tentative hypothesis about a plausible link to more widespread attitudes about CNN as “fake news” in certain states such as North Dakota. Noteworthy occurrences across the states are those of the seemingly omnipresent Senator Marco Rubio and the #STUDNETSSTANDUP hashtag, among others. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking at states with very high estimated gun ownership rates, such as Montana, Texas, or Arkansas, one can notice that NRA related terms, including the representative Dana Loesch upon her entrance around the 70th minute, are quite prominent, which may indicate either that even the more pro-gun users don’t shy away from addressing the topics despite the negative coverage in the town hall, or that even in more conservative states, the users that decide to tweet about the event are more likely to support stronger gun-control, and are likely to express their attitude online although they may be less prevalent in the area.
            </p>
            <p>
                The latter seems to be the more likely explanation, considering the fact that, using the first tool to inspect the volume of tweets about NRA rep. Dana Loesch over time, even the most positive tweets that appear are very negative, across the US. These findings together, may support two plausible hypotheses: (i) that the average viewer of the CNN town hall may be  slightly more likely to hold liberal political attitudes, which is in line with what we <a href="http://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/cnn/">know about the viewership of CNN</a>; or (ii) that people are in general more likely to tweet when they feel strongly about an issue, and this happens to be quite negative on the particular issues discussed in the town hall. 
            </p>

        <h3>
            What was Discussed?
        </h3>
            <p>
                For this tool, we preprocessed the transcript of the town hall event (provided by <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/22/politics/cnn-town-hall-full-video-transcript/index.html">CNN</a>), with LDA - a generative statistical model that aims to explain the linguistic content of documents by estimating which are the topics that each document consists of. Each document (here, sentence in the town hall transcript) is assumed to be a mixture of the extracted topics, where each topic is characterized by a probability distribution over all the words. Then, with the output we obtained, we visualized the findings by adapting the below interactive tool, developed and studied by Shirley and Sievert, which is designed to aid answering three questions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    What is the meaning of each topic?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How prevalent is each topic?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How do the topics relate to each other? 
                </li>
            </ol>
                <p>
                    Different elements of the visualization address each of these questions.
                </p>

                    The left and right panels of our visualization are connected so that clicking on a topic (circle) on the left renders the most useful (explained below) two-word phrases for interpreting the selected topic. To answer (2) and (3), one uses the panel on the left: the area of a circle is proportional to the overall prevalence of the corresponding topic in the town hall transcript, while the distance between the centers of two circles is here shown as proportional to the (symmetric) Jensen-Shannon divergence between any two topic probability distributions - in other words, the further away two circles are, the less similar the topics they stand for are.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hovering over one of the phrases in the horizontal bar-chart on the right panel once a topic is already selected yields the conditional distribution over topics (on the left) for the selected phrase, with the changing circle areas emphasizing the conditional probabilities of that phrase appearing within other topics where the phrase is present (and the remaining topic circles disappearing). This is meant to allow exploring the relation between topics and phrases, but it also adds to the intuitive experience of the distance between the topics.

                    Finally, “to interpret a topic, one typically examines a ranked list of the most probable terms in that topic, using anywhere from three to thirty terms in the list. The problem with interpreting topics this way is that common terms in the [whole] corpus often appear near the top of such lists for multiple topics, making it hard to differentiate the meanings of these topics.” For this purpose, included here is the interactive λ relevance metric. In short, “setting λ = 1 results in the familiar ranking of [phrases] in decreasing order of their topic-specific probability, and setting λ = 0 ranks [phrases] solely by their” topic specific probability divided by the overall marginal probability of the phrase in the whole transcript (for details, see the <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/events/illvi2014/papers/sievert-illvi2014.pdf">original paper</a>). In other words, by setting the λ one decides how much to weigh more uniquely characteristic phrases in the ranking for a given topic rather than just by ranking the straightforwardly most frequent phrases within the topic, which may be very frequent across the town hall transcript. The optimal value is subjective and depends solely on what is most suitable for human interpretation of the meaning of a topic. By examining the resulting bar charts in the right panel, one can hopefully infer what the topic is about. The static bar charts preceding the interactive visualisation discussed above are equivalent to the case of λ = 1, without all the other features.

                    The static bar charts above are equivalent to the case of λ = 1 in the interactive visualization, without all the other features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We address the first question the interactive tool was developed for by examining the bar charts while setting λ somewhat arbitrarily around 0.5 for a ranking balance between more unique yet still very frequent phrases within each topic. The meanings of the four extracted topics (subjectively) seem to be:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            on law enforcement, gun-violence prevention as related to specific weapon bans, possibly as discussed by the NRA rep. Dana Loesch and Sheriff Israel
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the phrases more uniquely associated with topic 2 seem to be tied to the students, teachers, and families, as well as to Donald Trump’s proposal to arm teachers; while Sen. Rubio is prominently present across across all the topics, his beliefs feature very significantly in this topic, possibly tied to his justification for receiving campaign contributions from the NRA and the above policy proposal
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the distinguishing phrases in the third topic seem to, as in topic (1), to be about policy proposals and which straightforward steps need to be taken to make sure such incidents don’t occur (such as background checks)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the fourth topic is somewhat harder to interpret than the rest of the topics as it consists of a seemingly miscellaneous set of phrases, ranging from Washington, D.C., to specific weapons, and, most uniquely, “unidentified female.” This last phrase offers a clue to better understand the meaning of the topic when opening the text of the transcript, which reveals that several of the female students were quoted in the transcript as “unidentified female,” suggesting that what or how they discussed the issues with the other guests was distinctive.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the topics are represented as circles of similar areas, indicating that their prevalence was similar in the corpus, i.e. the transcript. The distance between the distributions of the topics is largest between (4) and the rest, which is intuitive given the harder interpretability of the latter. Topics (1) and (3) are quite close, in accordance with the similarity in how we interpreted their meanings based on the most relevant phrases, while the distribution of topic (2) is not close to any of the remaining topics, but not as far from those of the rest as that of (4), which again matches our subjective interpretation of the meaning of topic (2).

        Executive Summary
    </h2>
        <p>
            Addressing the key questions identified earlier, the tweeters seemed to feel particularly strongly about Sen. Rubio and expressed their opinions pertaining his opinions and public appearance more frequently than on any other person involved (including the other Senator who was present). The vast majority of tweets about Sen. Rubio expressed a very negative sentiment. Two points in the event caused an even higher volume of tweets: his interaction with a father of a student killed in the shooting, who labeled Rubio’s and president Trump’s statements “pathetically weak,” and with Cameron Kasky, a student who directly demanded Rubio answer whether he would continue to accept NRA donations, which the Senator attempted to dodge, to highly negative reactions from tweeters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Interestingly, the NRA spokeswoman, Dana Loesch, was discussed at the very beginning of the debate, despite her absence from the stage until an hour later, which revealed that tweeters were aware of her role in the NRA before she was introduced. Donald Trump’s “arming teachers” policy proposal, as well as his effort to draw attention away from the town hall with another event are some of the likely explanations for his own prominent presence in the tweets despite an absence from the event. Independent reasons supporting the former explanation are presented below (regarding the topics discussed in the town hall event by its participants).
        </p>
        <p>
            For the less prominent participants, the mentions in tweets are expectedly correlated with the time they appear in the debate. That’s particularly noticeable for Cameron Kasky, Emma Rodriguez and Rep. Ted Deutch, where people reacted a lot to the remarks when those have been made and then less and less with the debate moving on. This reveals how people use twitter to instantaneously react about some remarks and events.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moving on to exploring how tweeters reacted to the debate in different parts of the country,  one can notice by comparing within-area frequency of tweets across time  in the Southwest and the Midwest, that the number of tweets increases markedly as the town hall event evolves. One can explore the within-trend with more granularity by focusing on a specific state over time. Compared to other sparsely populated areas, a relatively  high number of tweets were tagged in certain parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Montana. Within Texas, Austin, a more Democrat-leaning city, seems to be less active than Dallas, though they are of similar sizes, which may point to a relationship between gun ownership rates or political leanings and inclinations to tweet about the event. By utilizing the feature that yields the most frequently tweeted words in a state up to a point during the town hall event, one can notice prominent appearance of (Jake) Tapper in North Dakota, which gives another tentative hypothesis about a plausible link to more widespread attitudes about CNN as “fake news” in certain states such as North Dakota. Looking at states with very high estimated gun ownership rates, such as Montana, Texas, or Arkansas, one can notice that NRA related terms, including the representative Dana Loesch upon her entrance around the 70th minute, are quite prominent, which may indicate either that even the more pro-gun users don’t shy away from addressing the topics despite the negative coverage in the town hall, or that even in more conservative states, the users that decide to tweet about the event are more likely to support stronger gun-control, and are likely to express their attitude online although they may be less prevalent in the area. Our evidence indicates the latter to be the much more likely explanation, considering the fact that, using the first tool to inspect the volume of tweets about NRA rep. Dana Loesch over time, even the most positive tweets that appear are very negative, across the US. These findings together, may support two plausible hypotheses: (i) that the average viewer of the CNN town hall may be  slightly more likely to hold liberal political attitudes, which is in line with what we know about the viewership of CNN; or (ii) that people are in general more likely to tweet about political issues when they feel strongly about them, and this happens to be quite negative on the particular issues discussed in the town hall. The second explanation here is strongly supported by the sentiment analysis used in our first tool, though the former may well be a significant factor as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, exploring the topics of the town hall by examining the transcript of the town hall event itself (rather than the tweets about the town hall) with a generative statistical model reveals the pre-set four topics to be on: (1) law enforcement, gun-violence prevention as related to specific weapon bans, possibly as discussed by the NRA rep. Dana Loesch and Sheriff Israel; (2) the students, teachers, and families, as well as to Donald Trump’s proposal to arm teachers and Sen. Rubio’s opinions, possibly tied to his justification for receiving campaign contributions from the NRA; (3) similar to the first topic, policy proposals and which straightforward steps need to be taken, such as background checks; and (4) the distinctive conversations several of the students, particularly Emma Gonzalez and had with the lawmakers on the topic of gun control in general. We found the first and the third topic to be quite similar, while the second topic was more remote from the pair, and the fourth topic the furthest away from the rest.
